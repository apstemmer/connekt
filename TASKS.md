# Tasks
## Homepage components
need to create
- navigation bar
brings out menu bar, link to homepage, link to profile
- main banner
rotates through images of stuff we are trying to promote, with links that are relevant.
- search bar
search bar (maybe wait to add functionality). (maybe have drop down suggestions?)
- bunch of ad listings
create a component of ad preview that we can see basic info (like what appears after search result)
## linking buttons to pages
for example, on the homepage, we have menu and profile buttons. We could just do dummy pages for now, which the homepage.
## database
create easy ways of updating a table. Also, still need to work out how to store images/other media.
